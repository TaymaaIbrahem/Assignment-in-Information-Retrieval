The diffusion of artificial intelligence (AD
applications in organizations and society has fueled
research on explaining AI decisions. The explainable
Al (xAD) field is rapidly expanding with numerous ways
of extracting information and visualizing the output of
Al technologies (e.g. deep neural networks). Yet, we
have a limited understanding of how xAlI research
addresses the need for explainable Al. We conduct a
systematic review of xAl literature on the topic and
identify four thematic debates central to how xAl
addresses the black-box problem. Based on this critical
analysis of the xAI scholarship we synthesize the
findings into a future research agenda to further the
XAI body of knowledge.

1. Introduction

Machine learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence
(AI) technologies including neural networks (NN)
variations, are evolving at a rapid pace and thereby
expanding their capabilities, resulting in advanced
models being used more frequently in decision making
processes [1]. As these models are integrated in
organizations and daily work, academics and
practitioners need to pay more attention to the
development process of the models and_ the
interpretation of the outcome [2]-[4]. This is important
as vital decisions are increasingly being supported or
fully automated by different forms of algorithms that
are not fully understood by people, - known as the AI
black box explanation problem [5]. If we cannot
explain the algorithms, we cannot argue against them,
verify them, improve them, or learn from them [6], [7].
Both practitioners and academics call for better
understanding of the complex and opaque models by
implementing transparent and understandable ML-
models. Generating explanations of how the ML-
models work and how results are produced, leads to
increased trust in machine learning models [5], [8]-—
[10].

Explainable AI has emerged as a response to the
increasing “black box” problem of AI, according to
which models and their performance are not

techniques seeking to provide insights into the outcome
of a ML-model and present it in qualitative
understandable terms or visualizations to the
stakeholders of the model [9], [25], [33].

xAlI initially started from the computer science
community who were building xAI methods providing
a technical solution to the problem. With the diffusion
of AI applications in business and society xAI has
evolved to a broader research domain. From being
viewed as the extraction of advanced statistical values
for developers to identify information gain and entropy
of variables, more advanced frameworks like LIME
offer user friendly visualization of local instances for
the user to interpret. The emerging adoption of AI adds
another layer of complexity to human-computer-
interaction (HCI), where xAI has the potential to play a
central role in the behavioral and cognitive aspects of
Al- assisted decision making. The Al-based systems
are not new, they are descendants of expert systems
[92] utilizing more advanced technologies (e.g.
machine learning algorithms). Yet, they suffer from
opacity in terms of their ability to explain how
conclusions are reached. Hence, the xAI technology
could potentially either clutter or better explain the
decisions made or assisted by an algorithm. The critical
and systematic analysis of published research
constitutes an important vehicle in understanding the
current state of xAI scholarship [15]. This analysis
identifies the major thematic debates within xAI
research and proposes future research directions.

We reviewed xAI literature focusing on purposes,
definitions and actions related to xAI. We respond to
the call for focusing on metahuman systems - a unique
kind of sociotechnical systems - which are blurring the
boundaries between the social and the technical in
unanticipated ways [11]. We consider xAI as such a
system that calls for novel inquiry [11], [16].

Our contribution is twofold. First, we identify four
thematic debates central to how xAI research addresses
the need for explainable AI. Second, taking a
sociotechnical perspective in assessing the debates we
identify two future research avenues: a) the need for a
stakeholder approach and recognizing that different

Page 1284
stakeholders have different explainability needs b) the
need for a holistic view on explainability - jointly
accounting for the social and the technical aspects, the
process and the outcome aspects, as well as the factual
and the storytelling aspects of xAI. We argue that to
advance theories and practice on xAI, the Information
Systems (IS) field is in need of empirical studies that
show how different xAI frameworks address the
different stakeholder needs.

In the following sections, we first describe the
methods used to conduct a systematic literature review.
This is followed by our findings, which we structured
around four thematic debates in the xAI literature.
Finally, we discuss the findings and propose a future
research agenda for xAI research.

2. Method

We performed a systematic literature review using
strategies from Webster and Watson [17], and Jones
and Gatrell [18] focused on creating a theme- centered
retrospective view of current literature in xAl,
generating insights about the current debates and
identifying gaps for guiding further research [19]. The
review consists of search, selection, analysis, and
synthesis processes. Our aim was to provide a critical
analysis of the field rather than providing a descriptive
overview [18], [20].

2.1. Search and Selection Criteria

In order to identify relevant literature for this study
and accommodate the interdisciplinary field of xAI, we
used a broad collection of scientific databases: ArXiv,
Association for Information Systems (AIS), JSTOR,
ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library,
SAGE, and Science Direct. These databases were
chosen to ensure a diversity in both computer science
and social sciences for abetter representation of papers.
Due to the emerging nature of the field of xAI, ArXiv
was included in the selection of databases to allow
previews and submission of papers for journal articles
and conferences.

We used the terms “xAI’, ‘explainable artificial
intelligence’ or ‘explainable AI’ to search for articles in
the above databases. The reason for not including
‘interpretable’ is partly due to the shift in terminology
in recent years [21], [22], and the notion that
‘interpretation’ has mostly been focused on technical
methods for information extraction and not generating
explanations [13]. We searched for articles where the
terms appeared in titles, keywords, abstracts, and full
text. Due to the novelty of the xAI field and its rapid
development we conduct the search for the last 5 years
from 2016-2020. This search resulted in a total of 221
articles comprised of journal articles and conference
papers.

Next, articles were screened to determine their

relevance based on their abstracts and full text.
Inclusion criteria were theme-related to the purpose of
the literature review. Papers discussing the purpose,
need, reason and capabilities of xAI were initially
included. Conceptual and technical studies focusing
only on technical performance of xAI methods and
techniques that did not engage in a discussion of the
xAI problem or need were discarded. Thus, when a
method was explained, without paying attention to
issues such as validity, interpretation of output, or trust,
but merely generating transparency in opaque models,
the study would be excluded. Along the same lines,
discussion and opinion papers advocating for xAI as a
way to increase transparency of ML-models without
further elaboration were also discarded.

The search strategy included going both
backwards and forwards searching in citations to
identify prior articles of interest for possible inclusion,
and identify key articles with high impact in the field of
xAI [21]. After the inclusion of further literature and
selection based on the above inclusion and exclusion
criteria, the final review included 64 papers.

2.2. Literature Analysis and Synthesis

Considering xAI as a metahuman system - a
unique kind of sociotechnical systems [11] we
examined the articles with a sociotechnical lens in mind
[16]. A sociotechnical approach takes a holistic view
where relations among people, technology, tasks and
organization are sustainable. From previous IS research
we know that “poorly designed sociotechnical systems
with inadequate concern with mutual relationships
were shown to fail and produce unintended or
unwanted outcomes” [11, p. 8]. Taking this as a
departure point we examine the article pool if concerns
like a) a holistic view of social and technical aspect are
considered in the xAI literature, b) consideration or
participation of relevant stakeholders in xAI design,
development and use processes.

During the analysis the primary researcher read all
the articles thoroughly and identified topics that were
discussed across articles. For each paper, key findings
were included in a summary and comments on their
different approaches to the topic was noted [17] while
open coding [90] was applied by highlighting insights
that seem relevant to the review’s scope i.e. how the
papers addressed the need for xAI. In this way, the
primary researcher built a set of concepts and insights
based on the excerpts supported by the papers. As a
result, a concept matrix was made that was enriched and
updated as more articles were read. In the next stage, all
three researchers engaged in axial coding [90] in order
to identify higher order categories by understanding how
some concepts relate to other concepts in the matrix.
The analysis of the article pool was ongoing and
evolving in an inductive manner, as thematic debates

Page 1285
emerged under a) motivating the need for xAI, b) the
completeness vs interpretability dilemma c) explanation
for humans, d) technical frameworks for xAI. As
themes took form, some themes cover broader areas
than others as their nature is more diffused.

3. Findings

In this section, we present the four thematic
debates that emerged from analyzing the article pool.

3. 1. Motivating the Need for xAI

Exploring the recent literature on xAI and the
purpose of the technology, we observe conceptual
differences on how xAI is defined.

There are various interpretations of the
foundational concepts such as explanation vs.
interpretation and their related concepts. Some
researchers use both terms interchangeably, while
others depict the differences in the two conceptual
chunks.

Miller [8] articulates how an explanation in social
science is regarded as a two-step process consisting of
a) the cognitive process, explanandum describing the
cause for an event whereof a subset of causes is
selected as the explanation (exp/anas) and b) the social
process of transferring knowledge between explainer
and explainee in an interactive manner. Whereas
Brand§o et al. [23] takes their stance describing a ‘good
explanation’ as an explanation where the explainer
understands what the explanation means to the person
who asks for it, as they stress the need for investigating
the social meaning of what it means to others than
developers and researchers.

As Brian and Cotton argue, the terms of
interpretability and explainability (and the variations
hereof) are intertwined and still cluttered in their
definitions “Explanation is closely related to the
concept of interpretability: systems are interpretable if
their operations can be understood by a human, either
through introspection or through a_ produced
explanation. ” [24].

Other scholars [9], [22] take a more pragmatic
view and argue that ‘interpretation’ is closer to the
development of models and constitutes the opposite of a
‘black-box’ model, where the search for a direct
understanding of the mechanism by which a model
works is the aim of interpretable ML.

Others define interpretation as the means to
explain or to present in understandable terms to a
human [25] and directs the research in terms of how
humans interpret information. Liao et al. argue for a
more diverse approach to xAI, taking into account the
different user needs. They describe xAI as “...an
example, one of the most popular approaches to
explain a prediction made by a ML classifier, as
dozens of XAI algorithms strive to do, is by listing the

features with the highest weights contributing to a
model’s prediction” [26] which for developers might
be of high value, however not for the average layman.
These different definitions reveal the need for further
conceptual alignment in the xAI field. The following
sections present the main drivers for xAI systems.

3.1.1. Generate Trust, Transparency and
Understanding. Generating trust, is a major driver for
xAI and is strongly related to transparency. DARPAs
XAI program promotes the need for xAI, as we need to
further understand, trust and manage the emerging
generation of artificially intelligent machines [27].
Along these lines, lies a great effort and research
focused on extracting information from models or build
simpler models in the quest of delivering both
transparency, understanding and thereby generate trust
in the models [8], [22], [28]— [34]. Gilpin et al. [34]
argue that:” ... models that are able to summarize the
reasons for neural network behavior, gain the trust of
users, or produce insights about the causes of their
decisions...” [34]. Along with DARPA, the general
increase in ML performance and use has created the
search for better understanding of the models to
increase trust and thereby an increased use of ML in the
industry [35], [36]. Moreover Miller [8] argues that two
complementary approaches will generate more
transparent, interpretable, and explainable systems to
thereby make us more equipped to understand and trust
the models [8]: 1) Interpretability and Explainability
understood as how well a human understand an
explanation in a given context and 2) An explanation of
a prediction (decisions) to people (target audience).
Most technical xAI approaches aim at extracting
information from a model (it may be e.g. neural
networks or random forest) such as feature importance,
relative importance scores, sensitivity analysis, rule
extractions or other methods to generate greater
transparency. These xAI approaches and frameworks
mainly work from the perception of transparency may
improve understanding and thereby increase trust — or
the opposite that ‘black-box’ models are not to be
trusted [9], [31], [33], [37].

Few papers include socio-technical aspects in the
technical models presented. However few address the
obstacles in stakeholders understanding the output
which includes a consideration of the output as a socio-
technical aspect of an explanation, a HCI- dilemma and
addressing the risks in producing explanations for
developers, created by developers (inmates running the
asylum) [38], [39]. For example Zang and Zhu [40]
presents a graphic logic (or symbolic logic) to ease the
understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN), instead of only information extraction; While
Mueller et al. [29] visualizes pixels used to determine a
husky from a wolf to test participants through LIME. In
this way, they address the need for human

Page 1286
understanding by testing their explanation on
participants evaluating whether they trust the algorithm
[33]. Furthermore, the literature emphasized that the
xAI frameworks generating explanations are built by
developers or technical people focusing on the
computational problems in extracting data, which will
not necessarily solve the issue of trust [8], [23], [38],
[41], [42].

However, many conceptual papers call for
interdisciplinary work and discuss the need for more
focus on human understanding or interpretability, and
not only transparency [9], [21], [25], [26], [34], [43].

3.1.2. Ensure Compliance, follow Regulations and
GDPR Laws. One of the many reactions to new
regulations and GDPR laws is the call for xAI to
provide explanations not only to the users, but society as
a whole [22]. This, along with other regulations, makes
it urgent for practitioners and industries to ramp up the
investment in explaining opaque models [29], [34]. The
GDPR regulation and ’the right to an explanation’ has
caused great stir within both research and the industry,
directing them towards xAI - as a possible solution for
being compliant [44]-[46]. Moreover, some researchers
argue for regulation of xAI itself, or the possibility of
setting a standard or quality measure to ensure a
responsible use of xAI and avoid building persuasive
models instead of explainable ones [47], [48]. The
fallacies of building persuasive explanations are very
well described in Gosiewska and Biecek’s [49]
examples of how additive models can cause misleading
guidance on instance-level explanations which is
backed by Rudin [50] who argues against the recent
trend of building (additive) explainable post-hoc
“misleading” explanations.

3.1.3. For the Sake of Social Responsibility,
Fairness and Risk Avoidance. Especially, within
healthcare, clinical and justice work, risks and
responsibility are a major concern, as they are
potentially dealing with human lives and not merely
cost-benefit analyses [9], [51], [52]. Risk avoidance
occurs as responsibility is assigned to the individual
professional. Hence, developing mental models for
expert (e.g. clinical) reasoning to develop better
understanding of the reasoning behind deep neural
networks and opaque models [53]-[55]. Moreover,
recent events of discrimination and recidivism in
opaque models have fueled the debate on ensuring
fairness in model performance and _ deeper
understanding of how they are built. Cases of
minorities in hiring processes [56], recidivism in the
COMPAS system and general fairness [48] have added
to the surge in the xAI literature [6], [22], [34], [47],
[57].

3.1.4. Generate Accountable, Reliable and Sound
Models for Justification. A theme that has caused

great attraction towards xAI is the possibility to ensure
fairness and unbiased models by auditing them or create
proof of their rightfulness. Adadi and Berrada [21]
follow this approach and argue that xAI provide the
required results for auditing the algorithms and
generates a provable way for defending algorithmic
decisions as being fair and ethical. Hence, generating
algorithms that are not only fair and socially
responsible, but also accountable and able to justify
their output is another aspect motivating the need for
xAI. Amongst others, Abdul et al. [51] describes the
complications herein and present one of the more
popular approaches to generate xAI, by building
counterfactual explanations which are based on the
notion of causality and not just correlation. When
looking at the specific xAI methods, Doshi-Velez and
Kim [25] argue that global explanations of entire
models or groups are more appropriate for scientific
understanding or bias detection in models, whereas
local explanations are better suited for a justification
of a specific decision. Moreover, Liao and Anderson
[58] present methods for generating argumentation-
based justifications and explanations, based on formal
argumentation which provide natural arguments for
better reasoning of the models. Lastly, Ananny and
Crawford [59] bring forward a discussion of
transparency not being sufficient to govern and hold
algorithms accountable. They present different pitfalls
in the ideal transparent model and its limitations. They
claim that transparency does not necessarily build trust
as different stakeholders trust systems differently,
depending on their confidence upon when and what
information is disclosed, and how accurate and relevant
it is perceived to be [59].

3.1.5. Minimize Biases and Misinterpretation in
Model Performance and Interpretation. Biases in
models and their performance have shown to be an
important driver for xAI, as media coverage of models
performing sub-par to humans in e.g. filtering out
appropriate candidates in hiring processes [60] or
failing at recognizing people of color [61]. Especially
when dealing with neural network learning patterns
from training data, biased training data becomes an
issue that impacts the validity of the model output [62].
For these reasons, this sub-theme is also tightly linked
to the two previous sub-themes, as biased or
discriminatory models and their results are to no
purpose if not minacious in their implementation.
Besides biased training data [22], [63], variable
selection [64], [62] and representation [32], [33] , our
own cognitive bias can furthermore hinder our
interpretation of the visualized output from a model as
we tend to oversimplify the information [52]. Our
cognitive biases are argued to be mitigated by xAI
frameworks of various kinds, e.g. by Wang et al. [65]
who argue for pursuing reasoning theories and Arrieta et

Page 1287
al. [22], who argue that human cognitive capabilities
favors visual presentation of data.

3.1.6. Being Able to Validate Models and Validate
Explanations Generated by xAI. In response to biased
models and sub-par performance to humans,
researchers have found four types of evaluation
methods for deep neural networks (DNN) measured in
1) completeness compared to the original model, 2)
completeness as measured on substitute tasks, 3) the
ability to detect biases within a model, 4) human
evaluations [34]. Evaluating xAI is not only a question of
precision and feature extraction, as the user of the
output might not be able to understand the model
output. Others present a thorough taxonomy for
evaluation of interpretability, where the costliest is the
application-grounded approach which entails testing of
an implemented explanation and letting end-users test it
[25]. In this case the explanation is evaluated based on
identification of errors, new facts or less discrimination,
to the baseline of human-performance [25].
Furthermore, they present a human-grounded
evaluation for testing more general notions of quality
such as which type of explanation is best under time
constraints. The last evaluation approach is
functionally-grounded and fits the evaluation of
interpretability in already evaluated models or
immature model testing. This approach requires no
human interaction but rather measures optimization or

quality [25].

3.2. Completeness vs. Interpretability
Dilemma

From the debate of evaluating xAI, a debate of
whether we are able to make good explanations
emerges. The tradeoff between a correct (complete)
and a good (interpretable) explanation, is discussed by
Kim [66] where a pragmatic approach is needed if the
user (audience) should be able to understand the
explanation. Furthermore, Kim [66] continues to
present the notion of a ‘grasp-ability’ test to ensure the
audience can use an explanation that is not necessarily
perfectly transparent or rigorous, but graspable to the
audience. However, researchers have argued that the
need for explainability stems from incompleteness
producing different biases and argue that the nature of
the user’s expertise will influence the level of
sophistication the explanation can contain [25].

Many other researchers argue for the same tradeoff
between completeness (the goal of describing the
operation of a system in an accurate way) and
interpretability (here, the goal of interpretability is to
describe the internals of a system in a way that is
understandable to humans), as interpretability alone is
insufficient [34]. Hence, we should be cautious with
this tradeoff as humans have a strong specific bias
towards simple descriptions which can lead researchers

to create persuasive systems rather than transparent
systems. Humans lose trust in the explanation when
soundness is low [21], [34].

3.3. Human Explanations

In general, the literature agrees on the need for
building explanations that the user can understand.
However, different approaches on how to get there
appear. Different algorithmic approaches are capable of
producing different xAI outputs, depending on the level
of dependency on the model [21], [33]. The literature is
rather divided on the approaches of how explanations
are built as scholars either draw on_ theoretical
underpinnings from decision making _ theories,
philosophy and psychology [8], [65], [67], [68] or on
very sparse information on human understanding
focusing on computational problems, extraction of
performance measures and produce transparency in the
model output [23], [30], [31], [33], [69]. “Much of the
research about how to interpret and explain AI
behavior, they say, is driven by the needs of those who
build AI, and not necessarily of those who use if? (23,
p. 3].

On the other hand, studies that take a social
perspective focus on how humans_ experience
explanations:

1. Explanations are contrastive: Sought for in
response to counterfactual cases (foils). People ask
why P happened instead of Q.

2. Explanations are selected - in a biased
manner: People do not expect explanations that consist
of actual and complete cause of an event.

3. Probabilities in explanations do not matter,
causalities do: Referring to probabilities or statistical
relationships in an explanation is not as effective as
referring to causes.

4. Explanations are social: They are presented in
a context through transfer knowledge, interactions,
and conversations. People interact differently to
explanations [8].

The divide between these two approaches towards
building xAI constitutes a research gap from computer
science to social science. It also leaves an impression
of xAI users being either lay-users or developers with
only a few articles discussing the different roles in the
processes of xAI.

Few papers address the different AI literacy levels
users may have and even fewer address the diversity
of stakeholders and their different needs for xAI.
While there are various levels of AI literacy and
diverse subject domains, researchers focus on
developing a user-centric conceptual framework [65].
This seems to be the norm, as the users are rarely
defined as anything else as ‘user’, though sometimes,
when case examples are presented, users are
mentioned as e.g. clinicians, doctors or experts [54],

Page 1288
[55], [65], [70]-{73]. Only a few papers discuss
different types of roles and stakeholders in regard to
the ecosystem of xAI, and argue that one solution
might not fit the purpose of all different types of users
but we need to include the context, background and
knowledge of the stakeholders to produce
understandable explanations [52], [74].

For identifying the different stakeholders Arrieta
et al. [22] presents a framework — or target audience,
in relation to xAI and acknowledge that stakeholders
have different explainability needs in ML models. For
example, domain experts may seek out xAI to gain
scientific knowledge, whereas users affected by the
model’s decision may seek to better understand and
verify a fair decision was made. Arrieta et al. [22]
continue to present a taxonomy of the different
techniques that produce xAI within images, text and
tabular data.

3.4. The technologies producing xAI

Many different approaches towards building more
transparent and explainable models have been
presented in recent years in the search for opening the
infamous black-box. Models such as PD plots (Partial
Dependencies), ALE plots (Accumulated Local
Effects) ICE (Individual Conditional Expectation),

SHAP values (SHapely Additive exPlanations) and
LIME (Local Interpretation) are amongst the most
popular groundworks for feature-based models,
excluding image-based algorithms such as CNN [30]-—
[33], [40], [75}1{78]. The above mentioned methods
each have their different approaches but can be
classified as follows:

Intrinsically transparent: ML Models that are of
a simpler character, but also less precise than other
more advanced models (Linear Regression, Logistic
Regression, Decision Trees RuleFit) [22], [32].

Model agnostic xAI frameworks: These are often
of a post-hoc character, meaning that they are designed
to fit any model type and rely on techniques that
simplifies the model (rule-based extraction from the
complex model), show feature relevance estimations
(e.g. SHAP produces an additive feature importance
score for single predictions), visualizes the model (e.g.
ICE which visualizes the estimated model of
supervised ML models) or produce a local surrogate
model of the output (e.g. LIME)[22], [32], [33], [79],
[80]. A common thread of these frameworks is that
they produce some kind of visual output for easier
understanding. However, a thorough comprehension of
the output of additive models, can still be a challenge
to laymen [49], [82], [83].

4. Discussion and Future Research
Agenda

The analysis of the xAI literature shows that due to
the rather new and interdisciplinary field of xAI [24], a
common understanding of key concepts has not been
fully established yet. However, more recent work [8],
[22] is providing more comprehensive definitions
having a greater impact and shaping the field.

The nascency of the field is also evident in the
approaches towards building and designing xAI
frameworks and outputs which were driven by
developers. Recently, researchers have come to
understand the need for closer interdisciplinary work,
as the explanations originally built for the developers
— by developers, can serve more purposes than just
ensuring sound and reliable models. xAI as a means to
minimize biases, ensure social responsibility and
fairness is as much about data preparation and model
design as it is about proving that it is taken into
account. As a tool for developers, xAI can be of great
importance to ensure a model is based on causations
and not correlations, data is evenly distributed, and
features used are relevant. However, the demand of
knowledge from programmers, data scientists and
computer scientists is increasing as the stack grows.
Moreover, to possess the domain knowledge a clinician
might have within his field will never be reasonable,
however necessary to build sound models. This again
calls for more interdisciplinary research in xAI to
ensure we can collaborate across expert domains and
obtain the expertise from all related fields. This is in
line with recent calls from IS researchers for
interdisciplinary research into AI phenomena [11],
[84].

Considering the application of xAI in AI based
systems, the four thematic debates indicate that
organizations need to be cautious when choosing to
use an xAI method to address a specific need. For
example, additive models generating instance-level
explanations might be misleading to some [49], which
does not suffice for ensuring compliance or justify
explanations - but could suffice more general
explanations. As xAI is often seen as an enabler of AJ,
their goals are different from AI/ML. AI is for
optimization, augmentation and automation of
decision making, utilizing the ever so strong power of
machine learning. xAI is for exploring and
understanding the decision made by AI and as a means
to validate models and the performance of ML-
models. However, validating explanations and xAI
outputs is a much more complex process as it includes
the perception of the stakeholder who might not
possess the technical literacy level required to follow
the chain of logic in the model and explanation
combined [66], [25]. Further, xAI should be aligned
with the decision objective, which should guide the
choice of the ML-model, variable selection, hyper
parameter settings and other adjustments of the ML-

Page 1289
model. Besides the fact that xAI is costly in terms of
computational power and time, this in turn adds to the
complexity of any Al-solution, which argues for re-
evaluating the need for xAI in a solution.

To generate xAI models that satisfy regulators
and ensures compliance, especially within healthcare
and finance, has also shown to be of high interest as
this is a great entry-barrier for implementing ML in
these highly regulated areas [21], [22], [85], [86]. The
literature greatly suggests that xAI will ease this
barrier, however, there has not yet been any significant
empirical studies showing how xAI in fact may satisfy
regulators need to ensure compliance or undergo
audits. Therefore, we greatly encourage researchers to
address this issue with more empirical studies such as
Lauritsen et al. [87].

Another emerging topic in xAI is how to validate
the explanations and related frameworks. On one
hand, researchers need to ensure the human
interpretation is accommodated and on the other hand,
that the frameworks show information as it is, without
skewing the measures and building persuasive outputs
instead. We found that different streams of research
seem to favor either building intrinsically transparent
models, or post-hoc local explanations. Future
research should focus on meeting both these
contradictory yet interrelated needs combining process
transparency and storytelling of the outcome [88],
[89].

Moreover, reviewing the demand for knowledge
and how much xAI stakeholders need to understand in
terms of ensuring reliability in using it, was discussed
as there seems to be only little research into how much
information we need to interpret and understand. The
debate of completeness versus interpretability will not
disappear but the nature of users’ expertise will
influence the level of sophistication in the explanation
[25]. However, empirical studies are currently needed
to further investigate the relationship between
completeness and interpretability, but also if less
interpretability could possibly satisfy stakeholders
needs without becoming suggestive [91].

The six sub-themes which emerged throughout the
literature review constituting the motivation for xAI,
are highly interlinked, but each has their own
underlying purpose. We argue for further research into
building — or defining existing methods that fits the
purpose of the motivated need for xAI. This could be
either ensuring compliance or minimizing biases in
model performance. Developing and implementing ML
and xAI we need to ensure the chain of logic persists
both in development and production, and that the
chosen xAI framework fits the ML model and supports
the underlying goal of the intended explanation. One
could argue that the same methods might be feasible in
many cases, however, the goals of the underlying ML

models, and the explanations themselves are different.
Therefore, we call for further research in understanding
what kinds of explanation techniques fit the different
purposes intended.

The thematic debate of human explanations is
currently dominated by social science perspectives with
little attention to what the technology is capable of
producing. This reinforces the social - technical
dichotomy making for a very divided xAlI field:
focusing either on how we as humans interpret
explanations or how we can technically extract
information from complex models. While the current
state is justified by the nascent stage the field is in,
further research is required in understanding the
different xAI stakeholders needs and how they can be
satisfied with building more targeted explanations than
the two dominant groups of either developers or users.

Techniques and frameworks developed to produce
explanations are continuously evolving, including more
and more complex ML models. However, these
techniques and frameworks seldomly consider other
stakeholders besides developers themselves. Therefore,
continuing the path paved by Ribeiro et al. [33] we call
for further empirical research on how well the
frameworks are understood by different stakeholders.
We further argue for research in understanding what
xAI frameworks would support each purpose the best,
and which would be inexpedient.

While this research agenda is not exhaustive in any
way, it revealed two future avenues for xAI research:

a) the need to account for the different
stakeholders and their different explanation needs.
This research avenue highlights the importance of
investigating the micropolitics of xAI in organizations
and its implications for work.

b) the need for a holistic approach in
investigating xAI, jointly considering the social and
technical aspects of xAI, the process and the outcome
aspects of xAI, as well as the factual and the
storytelling aspects of xAI. This research avenue
emphasizes the need to understand conceptually and
empirically the complex nature of xAI as a new kind
of sociotechnical system and its implications for AI
practices in business and society.

5. Conclusion

The quest for opening the famous ‘AI black box’
has attained great traction in the past decade, as ethical
concems, regulations, and the need for controlling
these models has increased. Responding to the calls by
Miller [8], and Lipton [9] to generate further
perspectives and critical writings on xAI we perform a
systematic literature review on the need for xAI. We
first identify four thematic debates central to how xAI
addresses the need for explainable AI. Second, taking
a sociotechnical perspective in assessing the debates

Page 1290
we identify two future research avenues: a) the need
for a stakeholder approach and, b) the need for a
holistic view on xAI. Third, we argue that to advance
theories and practice on xAl, the IS field is in need of
empirical studies that show how different xAI
frameworks address the different stakeholder needs.
Based on future empirical evidence, we as scholars
may be able to judge to what extent xAI meets its
expectations, both for its stakeholders seeking to
strategically benefit from AI, and society as a whole.
