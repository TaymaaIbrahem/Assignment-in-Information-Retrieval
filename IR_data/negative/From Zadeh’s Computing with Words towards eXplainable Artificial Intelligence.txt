Extended Abstract

The European Commission has identified Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the “‘most strategic technology of the 21st
century” [7]. AI is already part of our everyday life through many successful applications into real-world usage and
according to Accenture [16] the economic impact of the automation of knowledge work, robots and self-driving vehi-
cles could reach between 6.5 and 12 €trillion annually by 2025. People are used to buzzwords like smart watch, smart
phone, smart home, smart car, smart city, etc. In practice, we are surrounded by smart gadgets, i.e., devices connected
to Internet and endowed with some level of autonomy and intelligence thanks to AI systems. The cohabitation of
humans and smart gadgets makes society demand the development of a new generation of explainable AI systems,
Le., AI systems ready to explain naturally (as humans do) their automatic decisions.

Thus, the research field on explainable AI is flourishing and attracting more and more attention not only regarding
technical but also ethical and legal issues [8]. The ACM Code of Ethics [1] highlighted explanation as a basic principle
in the search for “Algorithmic Transparency and Accountability”. In addition, Floridi et al. defined the concept of
“explicability” in reference to both “intelligibility” and “explainability” and hence captured the need for transparency
and for accountability in an ethical framework for AI [10]. Moreover, the new European General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) [14] refers to the “right to explanation”, i.e., GDPR states that European citizens have the right to
ask for explanations of decisions affecting them, no matter who (or what AI system) makes such decision.

The term eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was coined by the USA Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) [11]. Assuming that “even though current Al systems offer many benefits in many applications,
their effectiveness is limited by a lack of explanation ability when interacting with humans” DARPA launched to
the research community (including both academy and industry) the challenge of designing new self-explanatory AI
systems from 2017 to 2021.

In Europe, there is not any initiative similar to the DARPA challenge on XAI yet. However, the European Com-
mission has already pointed out the convenience of launching a pilot in XAI [7]. In June 2018, the Confederation of
Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe (CLAIRE’), a novel initiative to create a network of excel-
lence in AI with the most well-recognized universities and R+D centres, emphasized in its European vision for AI the
need to search for transparent, explainable, fair and socially compatible intelligent systems. Moreover, The AI4EU®

community to make AI promises real for the European Society and Economy; and (2) to create a leading collaborative
AI European platform to nurture economic growth. Explainable Human-centered AI is highlighted as one of the five
key research areas to consider and it is present in 5 out of the 8 experimental pilots to be developed.

In the rest of this manuscript we briefly review a selection of outstanding Zadeh’s contributions which are likely to
have direct impact in the research field of XAI. The paradigm of Computing with Words (CWW) is especially relevant
because humans are used to explanations in natural language (NL).

From Prof. Zadeh’s seminal ideas on fuzzy sets and systems [21], many key concepts such as linguistic variables
and linguistic rules have turned up in the field of Fuzzy Logic (FL). Accordingly, FL has many successful applica-
tions [19]. In addition, as it is described in [4], about 30% of publications in XAI come from authors well recognized
in the field of FL. This is mainly due to the commitment of the fuzzy community to produce interpretable fuzzy
systems [3]. Actually, interpretability is deeply rooted in the fundamentals of FL. However, it is worthy to note that
interpretability is not guaranteed only because of applying FL. In practice, producing interpretable fuzzy systems is a
matter of careful design [17].

In XAI, interpretability is a key issue but understandability and comprehensibility which are not so deeply consid-
ered by the FL community also play a prominent role. Nowadays, a new generation of intelligent systems is expected
to provide users with natural explanations. Those explanations should be easy to understand no matter the user back-
ground. Since, humans think and compute naturally with words, explanations in NL are likely to be considered as
natural explanations. Prof. Zadeh was the first to talk about CWW [22] as an extension of fuzzy sets and systems.
Later, Prof. Kacprzyk gave some hints about how to implement CWW [12]. Moreover, he highlighted the need to
connect CWW with the paradigm of NL Generation (NLG) [9]. It is worth noting that NLG is a well-known area
within the Computational Linguistics and AI research fields. The connection between FL and NLG has been further
researched by other authors [2, 15].

In addition, Prof. Zadeh was pioneer to introduce a new generation of more natural intelligent systems, ready to
compute with perceptions and make approximate reasoning as humans naturally do. Thus, the Computational Theory
of Perceptions (CTP) [20, 23] was first introduced by Zadeh and later applied by Trivino and Sugeno to automatically
generate linguistic descriptions of complex phenomena [18]. The CTP has been successfully applied for example to
explain the energy consumption at home [5] or to automatically generate linguistic descriptions associated to the USA
census data [6].

In addition, Prof. Zadeh also coined the concept of cointension [24]. The semantic-cointension approach [13] is
already applied to assess interpretability of fuzzy systems. Likewise, it can be considered when evaluating the un-
derstandability of explanations in XAI. In short, two different concepts referring almost to the same entities are taken
as cointensive. Accordingly, an explanation in NL is deemed as comprehensible only when the explicit semantics
embedded in it is cointensive with the implicit semantics inferred by the user when reading and processing the given
explanation.

To sum up, Prof. Zadeh made many highly valuable contributions to the FL field and beyond. Many of these
contributions were pioneer ideas and/or challenging proposals with a lot of potential to be fully developed later by
other researchers. Nowadays, XAI is a prominent and fruitful research field where many of Zaden’s contributions can
become crucial if they are carefully considered and thoroughly developed. For example, two major open challenges
for XAI are: (1) how to build conversational agents able to provide humans with semantic grounding, persuasive
and trustworthy interactive explanations; and (2) how to measure the effectiveness and naturalness of automatically
generated explanations. CWW as well as fuzzy measures and Z-numbers [25] introduced by Zadeh are likely to
contribute to successfully address both challenges and achieve valuable results.
