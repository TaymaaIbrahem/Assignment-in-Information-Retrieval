1. Introduction

Computing with words (CW) models [29], [56], [80], [94], [101] play a key role in
dealing with information linguistically. The classical CW models emphasize on
handling linguistic information based on the use of membership functions [101]-[104].
In CW, a mainstream is the linguistic symbolic computational models [14], [94]-[96],
among which the 2-tuple linguistic representation model [31] is widely used to handle
balanced linguistic information in the form of linguistic 2-tuples. Thereafter, different

methods are proposed to process unbalanced linguistic information, including the
proportional 2-tuple linguistic model [82], unbalanced linguistic term set [30],
numerical scale [18], and nonuniform ordered qualitative scale [23]. Considering
individuality of decision makers in expressing and understanding words, personalized
individual semantics (PIS) based models [16], [38]-[41] are introduced following the
stream of linguistic symbolic computational models. Another mainstream are the
type-2 fuzzy sets, because words mean different things to different people [60], the
type-2 fuzzy sets are used to deal with this issue [56]-[59].

In the last decade has been proposed two different concepts for representing
cognitive complex information, in 2012 the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS)
[70] and in 2014 the linguistic distribution (LD) [107], becoming two approaches in
modelling hesitant and uncertain linguistic information in decision making. (i)
HFLTSs are well qualified to represent decision makers’ hesitant preferences by using
comparative linguistic expressions. (ii) LDs provide certain symbolic proportion
information over linguistic terms to describe distributed preferences of decision
makers as distributed assessments. In [66], Pang et al. introduced the probabilistic
linguistic term set (PLTS), with a different name for the similar concept, and the use
of LD.

Compared with simple linguistic 2-tuples, complex expressions like HFLTS and
LD have improved the flexibility of expression and have shown to be very useful to
deal with complex decision making problems. In practical decision contexts with
complexity, decision makers are often uncertain and hesitant to make decisions due to
tight time pressure and lack of knowledge, and their linguistic preference information
may be presented in the form of distributed linguistic representations [17], [107].
These phenomena have raised the rapidly growing demand of modelling and
processing distributed preferences with efficiency, and advanced distributed linguistic
representations to become increasingly popular in decision making.

The aim of this paper is to present a review of the current hot topics of distributed
linguistic representations in decision making, including the taxonomy of distributed
linguistic representations, the key elements in distributed linguistic decision making,
and some challenges and future research directions from the perspective of data
science and explainable artificial intelligence (XAD).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the origin,
basic concepts and taxonomy of existing distributed linguistic representations. Then
Section 3 presents the key elements and applications of distributed linguistic
representations in decision making. Next, the challenges and future research
directions are discussed in Section 4. Finally, the main conclusions are drawn in
Section 5.
2. Distributed linguistic representations: origin, basic concepts, and taxonomy

In this section, we present the origin, basic concepts, and taxonomy of distributed
linguistic representations.

2.1 Origin of distributed linguistic representation: linguistic 2-tuples and HFLTS

In the development of linguistic decision making, various distributed linguistic
representations have been proposed to model decision makers’ linguistic preferences.
These distributed linguistic representations are basically derived from the following
two types of basic linguistic expression formats:

(1) Linguistic 2-tuples, which show their convenience in preferences construction
via single or two successive linguistic terms;

(2) HFLTS, which is well qualified to elicit hesitant preferences by using several
consecutive linguistic terms.

This section reviews the basic concepts of linguistic 2-tuples and HFLTS.

Definition 1 (2-tuple linguistic representation model) [31], [55]: Let

L= Hoots afe} be an established linguistic term set with odd cardinality satisfying the
required characteristics: (i) The set is ordered: 4,>/, if i>; Gi) A negation operator:
Negti,)=1, such that j=g—i, and g+1 is the cardinality of L. Let fe[0,g] be a
numerical value representing the result of a symbolic aggregation operation. Then, a
linguistic 2-tuple (/,a@), where ¢L and qae[-0.5,0.5) that expresses the
equivalent information to f is obtained by means of a one to one mapping:
A:[0,g] > Lx[-0.5,0.5), and

M(B) = U;,0) (1)

: L,i=round(P)
with 17 = B-i,e[-0.5,0.5)

where round is the usual round operation.

Let Z={(,,0)|1,¢L,a€[-0.5,0.5)} be the set of all the linguistic 2-tuples
associated to Z. The inverse function of A is denoted by: A‘:Z—>[0,g] with
A’(L,a)=i+a. If a =0, the linguistic 2-tuple (4,@) is a simple term /,. And the

negation operator of a linguistic 2-tuple (1.@) is defined by

Neg(1,,at) =A( g-(A"G,,2)))

Linguistic 2-tuple and its computational model [31] have shown good advantages
in constructing simple linguistic preferences of decision makers in linguistic decision
making. An overview on the 2-tuple linguistic representation model for CW in
decision making can be found in [55].

Wang and Hao [82] proposed the proportional linguistic 2-tuples, which add
symbolic proportion information to two successive linguistic terms.

3
Definition 2 (Proportional 2-tuple linguistic representation model) [82]: Let
L ={hob.sl,} be an established linguistic term set, 7=[0,1] and IL=IxL={(y,,
L)|y¥, €[0,1],4 ¢L}. Given a pair (/,,/,.,) of two successive terms of L, any two
elements (y,,/,) and (y,,,,4,,) of JZ are called a symbolic proportion pair, and
(%>¥%;4,) are called a pair of symbolic proportions of the pair (/,,/,.,) if y,+7,, =1.
A symbolic proportion pair (y,,/,) 1—y,,/,,) can be denoted as (y/,,d—7,)4,..)-
and the proportional 2-tuple set generated by L is denoted by

L={(7l.d-7 ha) 7, €[01L |, €L}}. (2)

The elements of Z are called linguistic proportional 2-tuples.
The negation operator for proportional linguistic 2-tuples is defined by

Neg ((7%1,,(1 —¥ Mia )) = (d wh Ve-iaFiles) :
To improve the flexibility of linguistic expressions, HFLTS [70] was proposed,
which acts as a tool in fulfilling decision makers’ hesitant necessities and

requirements by applying comparative linguistic expressions (several consecutive
linguistic terms). The concept of HFLTS is introduced as Definition 3.

Definition 3 (HFLTS) [70]: Let L={/,,/,...,/,} be an established linguistic term

set. An HFLTS, A, , is an ordered finite subset of consecutive linguistic terms of Z.

The expression of f, is given by

A, ={Ishavsl, (OSIS J Sg}. (3)

The negation operation for h, is defined by Neg(h,)= Ves [2 eh, fe {0,1..., gh} .

An approach to generate HFLTS based preferences via comparative linguistic
expressions by using a context-free grammar was presented in [70]. The recent
developments for HFLTS in decision making can refer to [69].

The distributed linguistic representations in this review have two origins:

(1) Extension of the proportional linguistic 2-tuple based representation, referring
to Zhang et al. [107], Guo et al. [25], [26];

(2) HFLTS with distributed preference information, referring to Wu and Xu [90],
Chen et al. [9], Pang et al. [66], Zhang et al. [109], etc.

In particular, distributed linguistic representations can be formed in two ways:
linguistic preference expressions with distributed information in an individual context
({17], [107], etc.), and information fusion of linguistic terms or HFLTSs in a group
context ([46], [100], [118], [119], etc.), which can be described in Fig. 1.

Fig.1 Formation of distributed linguistic representations in decision making

The distributed linguistic representations are reviewed in the following sections
in detail.
2.2 Linguistic distribution
Compared with HFLTS, LD provides some symbolic proportion information over
linguistic terms. The basic concept of LD is presented as Definition 4.

Definition 4 (LD) [107]: Let Z= aohseate} be an established linguistic term set.

AnLD over L is defined by
D, ={(1,,eG,))|i=0,1,...2}. (4)

where p(/,)20 is the symbolic proportion of /,, and ye p@)=1.

InanLD D,, 4 represents a linguistic term used by decision makers, and p(/,)

i

represents the associated symbolic proportion information of /, as a probabilistic
distribution associated to the linguistic terms (really it is a complete probabilistic
distribution).

The expectation of D, is defined by: EWD,)=A(D8,(A"G)x 0G))). and the

negation operator of D, was proposed [107]: Neg(D,)= {(4. PU.) I(4,00,)) eD,\

2.3 Incomplete versions of linguistic distributions

Distribution preference information provided by decision makers is not always
complete, and in the following we review the basic concepts of distributed linguistic
representations with incompleteness: proportional linguistic distribution (PLD), PLTS,
and incomplete linguistic distribution (ILD).

(1) PLD

Based on the proportional 2-tuple linguistic representation model, Guo et al. [26]
discussed the LD with partial symbolic information by introducing the concept of
PLD through a different mathematical representation.

Definition 5 (PLD) [26]: Let Z ={hobol,} be an established ordinal linguistic
term set, and /=[0,1] , MZ=IxL={(y,))|y, €[0.1].4 <L} be the set of

5
proportional 2-tuples of Z. Given a sequence of r+1 successive ordinal terms of Z, any
r+] elements (7,1). arly) o> “are4a,) Of i are called a symbolic

proportion sequence. The PLD is defined by
DP = {Hh Malas -Yardars®) [4 € 13} (5)
where 7j..%,,€0.1] , 0< 0" 7,<1, and O<i, itrsg . e=1->0"y,
represents the extent of incomplete information.
InaPLD D?, |, represents the preference judgment provided by decision makers,

and y, is the proportional coefficient of J,, which represents the decision maker’s

itr

confidence level that he/she believes a linguistic term fits an evaluation. If a!

itr

D? is called a complete PLD; if D. Vv, <1, DP is called an incomplete PLD.

The set of all the symbolic proportion sequences is called proportional linguistic
distribution set, denoted by 7: F ={(%h%oabea> MNiardbirpe€)(OSLI+K < gl, eL}.

In [25], Guo et al. discussed the PLD with interval symbolic proportions.

(2) PLTS

Pang et al. [66] proposed the PLTS to solve decision makers’ preferences with
hesitancy among several possible linguistic terms. Moreover, the incomplete
probabilistic distribution information of certain linguistic terms is considered.

Definition 6 (PLTS) [66]: Let Z={/,,4.../,} be an established ordinal linguistic

term set. A PLTS is defined by
L(p)={h (pI €L, p, 20,1 =1....nL(p)} (6)

where ee P, <1, and n(L(p)) denotes the number of element /, in L(p).

0

In a PLTS Lip), /, represents decision maker’s preference and p, is the

i

probability of 7. If 5°""’” p,=1, the probability distribution information of L(p)

Ey)

is complete; if an p, <1, partial ignorance exists because of decision makers’

knowledge limitation.
A computational model for handling incompleteness of L(p) is presented in [66].
Remark 1. A PLTS is transformed into an LD by using the normalization method
proposed in [66]. However, such transformation is questionable [40], which can be

demonstrated by using the following example. Let 1 ={/,,4,4,.4,,/,} be a linguistic
term set and L(p)={/,(0.3),/,(0.3)} be a PLTS. By using the normalization method
proposed in [66], an LD D, ={(4,0.5),(4,,0.5)$ can be obtained. Obviously,
L(p) = {1,(0.3),,0.3)} and D, ={(,,0.5),(4,0.5)} represent different preference
information. In fact, for two PLTSs L(p)={("(p’)|f’ EL, p? =0,i=1,2...,.0AL(pyy}
and E'(p)={U (py 2 EL, p; 20,7=1,2...nL py}. if nL’ (p)y=nL(p)), 7 =1, and
pi =Op, G=1,2,...nL(p)), then L’(p) and L’(p) will be transformed into the

same LD by using the normalization method proposed in [66], which is unreasonable.
(3) ILD
Zhang et al. [105] proposed the ILD, as shown in Definition 7.

Definition 7 (ILD) [85], [105]: Let L={hh,1,} be an established ordinal

linguistic term set. An ILD of LZ is given by
D, ={(4,.eG)).7|i=0.1....g} (7)
where eL, ))* ptl)+n=1, and pti), [0.1].
An ILD can be used to express a decision maker’s preferences with incompleteness.
Inan ILD D/, J, represents the linguistic term used by decision makers, and p(/,)

i

represents the relevant symbolic proportion information of /,. The variable 7
represents the extent of incompleteness and uncertainty in the preference D}. If
n=0, D; is complete and equivalent to the LD in Definition 4. Otherwise, the larger
n indicates the greater uncertainty in D/.

2.4 Flexible linguistic expression

HFLTSs and LDs have provided convenience in the construction of complex
linguistic expressions, but as a general format of linguistic preference expressions,
flexible linguistic expression (FLE) shows its advantages in linguistic decision
making, which is formally defined as follows.

Definition 8 (FLE) [86], [87]: Let L={hyh.-1,} be an established linguistic
term set, and S, be a set whose elements s, are the subsets of L. The decision
maker expresses his/her preferences by presenting distribution information of s,.
Then the decision maker’s preference is an FLE, denoted as /,, and it is formally
defined by

Sr ={(s,AS,)) 1s, € 5, } (8)
where p(s,)€[0,1].

Let the set of all the subsets of Z be S. The set S, is not fixed and S, cS. Inan
FLE f,. 5s, represents the preference expressed by decision makers, and p(s, )
represents the associated symbolic proportion information of s,. If s,¢S and
s,éS,, it means that s, is not used by the decision maker to represent his/her

preference. The negation operator of jf, is defined by [87]:
Neg(f,)={(Neg(s,).p(s,)) ls, €S,}, where Neg(s,)={I,_,|1,€5,}.

2.5 Other variants of LD

Moreover, there exist several representative distributed linguistic representations,
including LD with interval symbolic proportions (INLD) [17], possibility distribution
for HFLTS (PDHFLTS) [90], and proportional HFLTS (PHFLTS) [9], and hesitant
linguistic distribution (HLD) [109]. These variants are introduced below.

Dong et al. [17] proposed the version of LD with interval symbolic proportions.

Definition 9 (INLD) [17], [89]: Let L={hhsle} be an established linguistic
term set. An INLD is given by

D, ={(.pU))|, €L,i=0.1.....g} (9)

where (i) is the interval symbolic proportion of J _ satisfying

i

p= @).e" EC [0.1]. pe’) and p’(/,) are the lower bound and upper bound
of p,) respectively.

Inan INLD D , pt) represents the associated interval proportion information of

linguistic term /

i

, and the interval length of p(/,) reflects the confidence level of

decision maker when providing the preference |,. If p'(l)=p'(l), D, is
mathematically consistent with the LD in Definition 4.

Wu and Xu [90] proposed the PDHFLTS in group decision making (GDM) context,
in which decision makers provide their preferences via single terms and possibility
information is distributed over terms in an HFLTS.

Definition 10 (PDHFLTS) [90]: Let Z={/,.4...../,} be an established linguistic
term set, and A, be an HFLTS of LZ given by a decision maker. The PDHFLTS is
represented by

Dy, ={(L.P, 1h eh} (10)

1/n(h,) Leh,

where P=(p).p;,---P,) is the possibility distribution of fh, , r= {p otherwise

denotes the possibility assigned over the linguistic term /,, r p,;=1, and n(h,) is
the number of elements in A, .

Ina PDHFLTS Dy, , preference from a decision maker is represented by an HFLTS,
and each term /, in this HFLTS has the same possibility p, to become the

assessment value of an alternative.
Chen et al. [9] proposed the PHFLTS to solve HFLTS based preferences provided
by decision makers in GDM problems.
Definition 11 (PHFLTS) [9]: Let Z ={I,.h.-/,} be an established linguistic term

set, and Af (k=1,..,n) be n HFLTSs given by » decision makers. A PHFLTS based
on the union of Af is a set of ordered finite proportional pairs, represented by

Py, ={0,.P)\h €L} (11)
where (/,,p,) is called a proportional linguistic pair, P=(p,,p,...p,) iS a
proportional vector and p,¢[0,1] represents the possibility degree of J, provided by
n decision makers, and ye p=).

Chen et al. [9] discussed the case of PHFLTS with incomplete proportion
information, and mentioned that PHFLTS is mathematically consistent with LD in
Definition 4. Some associated computational approaches can be found in [10]-[12].

Zhang et al. [109] proposed the HLD, in which preferences of decision makers are
HFLTSs.

Definition 12 (HLD) [109]: Let Z ={h.h.-/,} be an established linguistic term
set, and #, be an HFLTS of LZ given by a decision maker. Let the set of all the
HFLTS of L be H,. The HLD is defined by

Dy, ={h,. Ph, h, €H,} (12)
where p(h,)e[0,1]U {null} and p(h,) is the symbolic proportion of A, if

Plh, ) # {null .
Inan HLD D,, , preference from a decision maker is a set of HFLTSs /, with

certain possibility p(h,), and the element #, is not used if p(h,)={null} . If

yn tt, pth, =1, D,, is complete; if > pel, pi) <1, D,, 8 with incompleteness.
Zhang et al. [109] proposed a normalization method for the case of > ell, pi,)>.

2.6 Taxonomy of distributed linguistic representations

We present the taxonomy of the existing distributed linguistic representations.
Based on the concepts of LD and its variants, their comparison results are listed in

From the above classifications, we can figure out the following characteristics:

(1) FLE is the generalization of almost all distributed linguistic representations
reviewed.

(2) LD, PDHFLTS, PHFLTS, PLTS, PLD, and ILD, are special HLDs.

(3) PLTS is mathematically consistent with ILD; and PLD shares high similarity
with PLTS and ILD, but in PLD symbolic proportions are distributed over successive
linguistic terms. Because this difference is minor, in this review we think that PLD is
equivalent to PLTS and ILD (approximately).

(4) PHFLTS is mathematically consistent with LD.

(5) PDHFLTS is the special case of LD.

(6) INLD is a generalization of LD.

The relationships among different distributed linguistic representations can be
described as Fig. 2.

PHFLTS

 

Fig.2 The taxonomy of distributed linguistic representations

Remark 2. To our knowledge, LD is the first attempt in the linguistic decision
making community to model the distributed linguistic representations. Although the
follow-up notions and concepts are mathematically consistent with LD in some sense,
they are designed with different purposes:

(1) The notions of PDHFLTS, PHFLTS, PLTS, HLD and FLE are designed for
10
extending HFLTS, while PLD, ILD and INLD are designed for extending proportional
linguistic 2-tuples.

(2) PDHFLTS is designed to the modelling of individual linguistic expression, and
PHFLTS is established for group linguistic representations as it involves the fusion of
individuals’ linguistic preference information.

3. Key elements and applications of distributed linguistic representations in
decision making

In this section, we show the key elements and applications of distributed linguistic
representations in decision making. Specifically, distance measurements and
aggregation methods under various distributed linguistic representations are
summarized in Section 3.1 and 3.2 respectively. Based on the use of distributed
linguistic representations, several distributed linguistic preference relations are
developed, which are introduced in Section 3.3. Following this, multiple attribute
decision making (MADM) models with distributed linguistic representations are
presented in Section 3.4. Finally, some real-life applications are reviewed in Section
3.5.

3.1. Distributed linguistic distance measurements

In this section, we review several widely used distance measurements in distributed
linguistic representations. To start with, in Table 2 we provide a summary of these
distance measurements (refer to column 4), which are the bases to support decision
making.

Next, the main distance measurements of LD, PDHFLTS, PLTS, ILD, and FLE are
reviewed.

(1) Distance measurements of LD and PDHFLTS

Let DI ={,p'h)|i=OL....g} and Di ={(L,p°(L)|i=0.1L...g} be two LDs.
Several methods for distance measurements in LDs were reported (see [33], [97],
[107], [119]).

The distance between Df and D; proposed by Zhang et al. [107] is provided as

follows:
r Ss 1 r Ss
AU(Di-Di)=F Dil @)-pG)I. (13)

Zhang et al. [119] pointed out that the above distance measurement defined by Eq.
(13) just calculates the deviation between symbolic proportions and ignores the
linguistic terms. To overcome this drawback, Zhang et al. [119] proposed another
distance measurement as follows:

d(D,.Di)=+1D% (0) 2°) NSU)
§ (14)
where NS(.) is the numerical scale [18], and NS(/,) is set to be /.

Ju et al. [33] proposed the following way to calculate the distance between LDs

12
Dr and Dr:

 

d(D; ,D;)= (XU) NSU)- P*(L,) NS)

Similar to Eq. (14), NSC) in Eq. (15) is set to be i.

(15)

Yao [97] used the following way to compute the distance between LDs D; and
Dp:

d(Dh.D)==S EIT e'I-S I
& (16)

Wu and Xu [90] discussed the distance measurement of PDHFLTSs. Let
Di’ ={d.p)|eL} and Di ={(,p*)|,<L} be two PDHFLTSs. The distance

between D’" and D/:° is defined by:

d(Di* Df) = : [De pl NSU)-Y, pr NS)| (17)
where NS(i,)=i, and Eq. (17) is equivalent to Eq. (14).
(2) Distance measurements of PLTS and ILD
Let L(p)={U (pf €L. pl 20i=1...nL(py} and L(p)={0 (pF €L.
p. >0,i=1,....n((pyy} be two PLTSs, and n(Z’(p))=n(Z'(p)). Pang et al. [66]
proposed the deviation degree between L'(p) and L’(p):

 

nL" (py)

dlp). =" (py sup (7 )— pi sus (EY /n(L(p)) (18)

where su’ and su° are the subscripts of linguistic terms /’ and /° respectively.
Zhang et al. [105] analyzed the distance measurement of ILDs. Let
Di” ={(L,e'(L)).17” |f=01,...g} and Di ={(h,p°()).7 |i=0,1,....2} be two ILDs.

Then, the distance measurement between ILDs D/?” and D/* is given by:

d(D" Di") = (EU) pl) -p'G)|+6 |" -9° ) (19)

where 5€(0,]] is a predefined distance parameter, and represents the importance

degree of incomplete information in the distance measurement.
(3) Distance measurements of FLE
Wu et al. [86] proposed the distance measurement for FLEs. Let

f, ={(8;,(s,))|8, €S,} be an FLE, and D;, ={(1,,e(,))|7=0.1,....g} be a PDHFLTS

UM fisPh = Dog es, | Dies, PU) SL) | (20)
where (s,)¢[0,1] is the symbolic proportion of the subset s, in /f, , and

3.2. Aggregation approaches of distributed linguistic representations

In this section, we review the commonly used aggregation methods for distributed
linguistic representations, which are summarized in Table 2 (columns 5 and 6).
(1) Aggregation approaches in LD, INLD
Let {D},D7,..,.D"} be aset of LDs of ZL, where Di ={(,,p'(,))|i=90,1.....2}, and
A=(AsAys-4,) be an associated weighting vector that satisfies 2,>0 and
4: =1. Zhang et al. [107] proposed the weighted averaging operator for LDs by:
LDWA,(D,,D7.....DP)= (hp ,)) |i =0.L....2} (21)
where p°()= 0" Ap") 7 = 0,L....2.
The ordered weighted averaging operator of LDs is computed by [107]:
LDOWA,(D) De... DY) =. pL) |i =0,1,-..2} (22)
where p°(/,)= vA pd) and {o(1),o(2),...00m} is a permutation of
{1,2,....m} such that De’? >pDe for k=2,3,...,.m.
Liang et al. [44] defined other operators for the aggregation of LDs. Let
{D),D7,..,D" be as above. The LD power average (LDPA) operator is defined by:

LDPA(D),,D?,...,DP) =40,, p° 4) |i =0,1,...,23 (23)
where
: mn 1+7(D}
p=" pe (24)
,.+7(D, ))
and T(Di)=)>)",, Sup(D}.Dr). Sup(D}.D;)=1-d(D},D7) is the support degree of

the elements Df and Dy.
Based on the LDPA operator, the LD weighted power average (LDWPA) operator
is defined by [44]:
LDWPA,(D),D7,...,D?") ={h.P°@))|i=90.1,....9} (25)
where
_AC+TD))

(26)
1% (+7 (D;))

pr) = yew)

Dong et al. [17] proposed the aggregation methods for INLDs. Let {D!D?,...,D™}

be a set of INLDs of L, where Dé ={(,p*(,))|i=0,1,...,g}. The weighted average
operator of INLDs is computed by:

INLDWA,(D}.D}....Di") = (0, Lp"). PUD |i =0.1,. 83 (27)

where pil=y 4 “pr(l). P= A -p'(l,). A, is the weighting vector of

14
Dé satisfying ve =1.
The ordered weighted average operator of INLDs is computed by [17]:

INLDOWA,(D}.,D}.....D?")= (Lp PED |i = 0d... 8} (28)

where p'(h)= Si A PP). PWD= Ae PU). {o(),0(2),...00m)} is a

~Ok-ly ok)

permutation of {1, 2,..,m} suchthat Di 2D: for k=2,3,....m.

Based on the use of LDs and HFLTSs, Wu et al. [88] proposed the maximum
support degree model (MSDM), aiming at maximizing the support degree as well as
guarantying the accuracy of group opinion, which is presented below:

max ¢(h; )
ph; ) = here ol,)
51.60) = AP)
n(h{)<T
h,¢H, (29)
where ¢(h;) is the support degree of the collective opinion Ay, ¢(/,) is the support
degree of the linguistic term 4 in D}. The constraint n(h’)<7 guarantees that the
number of linguistic terms in ff is less than a preset value 7, and constraint
hi eH, guarantees that hf is an HFLTS.

(2) Aggregation approaches in PLD, PLTS, and ILD
Let

be a set of PLDs, and D?* ={(%4 Va ath ro 9 Vhs di on Fe), el} (k =1,...,.m). Then,

the weighted average of PLDs in ®, which is also a PLD denoted by
OL Maha Mads, & [h.--4,, €L), is defined by Guo et al. [26]:

{ft =" AY Je +L.wit

é,= ve ME, (30)
where i is the minimum index of starting labels and i+r is the maximum index of
ending labels of PLDs in % __ respectively, ic, i=minfi,..,i,} and
itr =max {i +h,..5_, tht -

In addition, the weighted average operator for PLDs defined above can also be
extended for the case where the weights are expressed by means of uncertain
linguistic weights instead of numerical values [26].

Different aggregation methods have been proposed for dealing with PLTSs. Pang et

15
al. [66] and Liu et al. [49] defined the PLTS weighted averaging (PLTSWA) operator
respectively, and Liu et al. [49] also proposed ordered weighted averaging operator of
PLTSs (PLTSOWA). In addition, Han et al. [28] presented the concepts of
Archimedean copula weighted probabilistic unbalanced linguistic arithmetic average
aggregation operator and Archimedean copula weighted probabilistic unbalanced
linguistic geometric average aggregation operator.

Let {D!',D!’,..,Dr"} be a set of ILDs, where Di‘ ={(,e°(L)),7* |i=0,1.....g}.
Let DP ={,,0°C),7' |i =0,1,...,.2} be the collective ILD, Zhang et al. [105]
proposed the following model to obtain D/*:

. 1 m n Cc Cc
min pet Dagat Daveal Py LP; E145 L775 —75 D GB)
where p*(/,) is the symbolic proportion information of /, provided by individual i
for alternative g. 6 represents the importance degree of incomplete information in
the distance measurement of Di* and D?°.

Meanwhile, since D}’ is an ILD, we have that n PU)+7 =1, pd ye[01]
and 7° €[0,1]. In order to get relatively precise collective opinion, the incomplete
degree of D/* is set to be less than the average incompleteness of all decision
makers’ opinions, ic. 77° €[0.2°" 7°].

(3) Aggregation approaches in PDHFLTS, PHFLTS, HLD, and FLE

In [90], Wu and Xu defined the hesitant fuzzy linguistic weighted average (HFLWA)
operator and hesitant fuzzy linguistic ordered weighted average (HFLOWA) operator
for the aggregation of PDHFLTSs.

Chen et al. [9] defined the proportional HFLWA (PHFLWA) operator and
proportional HEFLOWA (PHFLOWA) operator for the aggregation of PHFLTSs. Let
{Py, Pq, >--»P7} be aset of PHFLTSs. The PHFLWA operator is defined by [9]:

PHFLWA(Py, .Py, Pi) =TG" (A, Py, |k =1,2,...5m)

<1 (AP, \@TG""(A Ph, |= 2...4m)) 6?)
The PHFLOWA operator is defined as follows [9]:
PHFLOWA(Py, .P3, 5...Pit.) =TG" (Ay Po | k =1,2,...5) (33)

=T((A,,P1,) @TG"" (A, Pe | k =2,....m))

where {o(1),o(2),...,0(m)} is a permutation of {1, 2, .... m} such that Py > PZ.

T is a triangular norm [3], [71], and G(-) is a proportional convex combination
function [9].

Zhang et al. [109] proposed the weighted average operator and ordered weighted

average operator for the aggregation of HLDs. Let D,, ={(#,.p'(a,))|h, €H,} and

16
Di, ={Gz.P' (hy) hp €H,} be two HLDs. Let 4 and 4, be the corresponding
weights, where 4,,4,20 and 4,+4,=1. Then the weighted union of D,, and D;,
is defined by [109]:

U (Dy, Piz.) =U(AD yr, AD.) (34)
where U(ADy, A,Di,,) = (hPa) | hy, © H,}, with

(h, Ap (h,)+ Ap (h;)), if ph, ), phy) # null, hy, = h;
(i pity) = lt 0 Uy UE Aap? h3)), Hf pC). p* (ip) # mal, by #
POND (hs if p'(h,) # nul, p*(he)= null
(h, Ap (h;)), if p(y) # null, p'(h,) = null . (5)

Let {Dy Di,.--.Diz,} be a set of HLDs, where Dy, ={(hp,p'(h;))|Ap ¢H,}
(k =1,2,...,m). The weighted average operator for {Dy Dj Di} is defined by
[109]:

HLDWA, (Dy, Di, yD y= U(ADy, U(AD;, pe Ay Diy )). (36)

The ordered weighted average operator of {Dy Di, w2Dy, } 18 defined by [109]:

HLDOWA, (Dy, Diz, Dit, ) =U ADA? U ADE? 54g De”)) (37)
where (o(1),o(2),...0(m)) is a permutation of {1,2....,.m} suchthat D7“) >D;.

Wt et al. [86] proposed an optimization approach for the aggregation of FLEs. Let
Si =4(st ,p(st))| st eS#} be the FLE preference of individual k (4 =1,2,...,.m), and
DP* be the collective PDHFLTS. Af is the HFLTS associated with D?* [86]:

min)" Ad(f; Dr)

Pr —PD,
n(hi)<T (38)

where 4, is the weighting vector of individual &, and »(hf) is the number of
elements in hy.
3.3. Distributed linguistic preference relation

Based on the use of distributed linguistic representations in the pairwise
comparison method, several distributed linguistic preference relations including
linguistic distribution preference relation (LDPR), probabilistic linguistic preference
relation (PLPR), and flexible linguistic preference relation (FLPR) have been reported,
which are summarized in Table 3.

this review are denoted as 4 =(a,)

symbolic proportions [74].

In many cases, words mean different things to different decision makers. In this
case, the LD preference relations are called PIS-based LD preference relations [75],
[76], [92].

The transformations between different distributed linguistic preference relations are
investigated by several researchers [87], [112], [114].

3.4. Distributed linguistic MADM

The distributed linguistic representations have been utilized in MADM to model
the uncertain assessments of decision makers, and several distributed linguistic
MADM approaches are developed accordingly, which are summarized in Table 4.

(1) MADM approaches with LD and INLD

The LD has been applied in MADM to represent uncertain assessments of decision
makers. Yao [97] proposed a consensus reaching model for multiple attribute group
decision making (MAGDM) with assessments represented by means of LDs, in which
a feedback mechanism is devised by combining an identification rule and an
optimization-based model. Wu et al. [84] presented a minimum adjustment cost
feedback mechanism based consensus model for MAGDM under social network, in
which the assessments information and the trust relationships among decision makers

19
are both represented by LDs. Based on the use of LDs and HFLTSs, Wu et al. [88]
proposed the MSDM to address linguistic MAGDM problem, which aims at
maximizing the support degree of group opinion as well as guarantying the accuracy
of group opinion. Zhang et al. [119] designed an approach to manage multi-granular
LDs in large-scale MAGDM, in which a linguistic computational model is developed
based on the extended linguistic hierarchies model and the transformation formulas
between a linguistic 2-tuple and an LD. Recently, Zhang et al. [120] developed a
large-scale MAGDM model with multi-granular unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic
information. In their model, all unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic information is
transformed into LDs defined on a balanced linguistic term set. Yu et al. [99]
proposed a method to deal with large-scale GDM problems with multi-granular
unbalanced linguistic information, in which the initial multi-granular unbalanced
linguistic information of decision makers is represented by unbalanced LDs and the
classical TODIM method is extended to derive a raking of alternatives. Liang et al.
[46] developed a consensus-based analysis model for MAGDM with multi-granular
LD preferences.

Dong et al. [17] proposed an MAGDM with INLD under multi-granular
unbalanced linguistic contexts. First, a basic linguistic term set is selected to
normalize the individual unbalanced INLDs matrices. Then, the collective unbalanced
INLDs matrix is obtained by aggregating the normalized individual unbalanced
INLDs matrices. Following this, the ranking of alternatives is obtained from the
collective unbalanced INLDs matrix.

(2) MADM approaches with PLD, PLTS, and ILD

In real-world MADM, due to the limitation of knowledge, problem complexity and
time pressure, the assessment information given by decision makers may not be
complete. Various distributed linguistic MADM methods to handle incomplete
assessment information have been proposed.

Guo et al. [26] proposed a PLD based model for MADM under linguistic
uncertainty, which is based on the nature of symbolic linguistic model combined with
distributed assessments. Moreover, this model is also able to deal with ILDs so that it
allows evaluators to avoid the dilemma of having to supply complete assessments
when not available.

Han et al. [28] proposed a new computational model based on Archimedean copula
for unbalanced PLTS and developed an MAGDM based on it. Liu et al. [51] presented
the bidirectional projection method for probabilistic linguistic MAGDM based on
power average operator. Liu and Li [50] developed an extended MULTIMOORA
method for probabilistic linguistic MAGDM based on prospect theory. Pang et al. [66]
developed an extended TOPSIS method and an aggregation-based method

respectively for MAGDM with probabilistic linguistic information. Tian et al. [77]
20
presented a probabilistic linguistic MADM based on evidential reasoning and
combined ranking methods considering decision-makers’ psychological preferences.
Wang et al. [83] proposed a distance-based MAGDM approach with PLTSs. Wang [81]
proposed a generalized distance measurements method between two PLTs with
multi-granular linguistic information, and applied them to deal with multi-granular
MAGDM problems. Zhou et al. [123] proposed particle swarm optimization method
for trust relationship based social network MAGDM under a probabilistic linguistic
environment.

Zhang et al. [105] developed a consensus-oriented aggregation model for MAGDM
with ILDs, which can obtain a collective opinion with maximum consensus, and
further developed a minimum-cost consensus model with variable unit consensus cost.
Zhang et al. [113] developed a deviation minimum-based optimization model to
manage ILDs in MAGDM by minimizing the opinion deviation among decision
makers, and proposed a consensus-reaching model with bounded confidences based
feedback adjustment mechanism to assist decision makers to gain a consensus.

(3) MADM approaches with PDHFLTS, PHFLTSs, HLD, and FLE

HFLTS based distributed linguistic MADM approaches have been proposed and
utilized to tackle a variety of decision problems.

Wu and Xu [90] proposed operation laws and aggregation operators and for
PDHFLTS and built a framework to deal with both consensus and selection processes
for MAGDM problems with PDHFLTSs. Wu et al. [91] examined an MAGDM
problem in which the linguistic information was represented by PDHFLTS, and
developed two approaches based on VIKOR and TOPSIS to find a compromise
solution.

Chen et al. [9] developed a proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic MAGDM model,
in which a probability theory-based outranking method for PHFLTSs was proposed
and two fundamental aggregation operators for PHFLTSs were provided.

Zhang et al. [109] proposed an approach for MAGDM with HLD, in which the
transformation between HLDs and LDs and the basic comparison and aggregation
operations to perform on HLDs are developed.

Wu et al. [86] proposed MAGDM with FLE. In the proposed model, an FLE
aggregation process with accurate constraints is developed to improve the quality (i.c.,
accuracy) of the collective result as well as guarantee the principle of minimum
preference-loss through a mixed 0-1 linear programming model. Meanwhile, the
consensus rules with minimum preference-loss are designed to support the consensus
reaching process in the MAGDM with FLE.

3.5. Some real-life applications

(1) Applications in failure mode and effect analysis

AS a proactive risk management instrument, failure mode and effect analysis
(FMEA) has been broadly utilized to recognize, evaluate, and eliminate failure modes
of products, processes, systems and services [24]. Due to various subjective and
objective conditions, it is often difficult for FMEA team members to provide precise
values for the assessment of failure modes. Instead, they prefer to utilize linguistic
labels to state their opinions regarding the risk of failure modes. Recently, the
distributed linguistic representations have been adopted to model the uncertain
opinions of FMEA team members. For example, Huang et al. [32] applied LDs to
represent FMEA team members’ risk evaluation information and employed an
improved TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multicriteria decision
making) method to determine the risk priority of failure modes. Ju et al. [34] proposed
new approaches for heterogeneous linguistic FMEA with incomplete weight

information as well as the idea to convert heterogencous linguistic information to LDs.
22
Nie et al. [64] developed a hybrid risk evaluation model within the FMEA framework
based on the use of multi-granular LDs and applied this model to supercritical water
gasification system. Zhang et al. [110] proposed a consensus-based MAGDM
approach for ordinal classification-based FMEA problem, in which FMEA
participants provide their preferences in a linguistic way using LDs. Zhang et al. [113]
integrated a consensus-reaching mechanism with bounded confidences into the FMEA
framework and adopts ILDs to represent risk assessment information. Zhang et al.
[111] presented the design of a PIS-based FMEA approach, in which members
express their opinions over failure modes and risk factors using LDs.

(2) Applications in hotel selection

With the considerable development of tourism market, as well as the expansion of
the e-commerce platform scale, increasing tourists often prefer to select tourism
products such as services or hotels online. Thus, it is necessary to develop efficient
decision support models for tourists to select tourism products. Liang et al. [43]
developed decision support model for hotel selection based on sentiment analysis and
LD-VIKOR method, where the text data are transformed into LDs via sentiment
analysis. Nie et al. [62] proposed a scientific hotel selection model to assist tourists in
choosing a satisfactory hotel and guiding hoteliers to gain competitive advantages in
the e-tourism era, in which LDs are used to summarize and denote evaluation values
under certain criteria associated with hotels. Peng et al. [67] developed an applicable
hotel decision support model for tourists utilizing online reviews on TripAdvisor.com,
in which PLTSs are introduced to summarize this information statistically by
considering a great deal of review information associated with hotels posted by
numerous tourists on TripAdvisor.com. Yu et al. [98] designed a mathematical model
to select appropriate hotels on websites based on LDs. Zhang et al. [106] proposed a
multi-stage MADM method based on online reviews for hotel selection considering
the aspirations with different development speeds, in which LDs are used to deal with
online reviews.

(3) Applications in sustainability evaluation and other selection problems

Water security sustainability plays an increasingly crucial role in maintaining the
balance between industrialization, urbanization and sustainability. Nie et al. [63]
established an observation data conversion standard and adopted LDs as information
representation and developed a multistage decision support framework by combining
several MADM techniques (such as, best-worst method, DEMATEL, and TOPSIS)
for water security sustainability evaluation. With the accumulation of practical
experience and the maturity of technology, constructed wetlands have gradually
become multi-functional ecological systems. Luo et al. [52] proposed GDM approach
for evaluating the sustainability of constructed wetlands with PLPRs.

The sustainable third-party reverse logistics provider selection, as the core of
23
sustainable supply chain management, has become paramount in research nowadays.
Luo and Li [53] utilized PDHFLTSs to deal with the situation in which decision
makers may hesitate in a few linguistic terms and have different partiality towards
each term in the actual evaluation process, and presented an MAGDM method by
combining PDHFLTSs and MULTIMOORA for the sustainable third-party reverse
logistics provider selection in the e-commerce express industry.

“No technology, no finance” has been the consensus in banking industry. Under the
background of financial technology (Fintech), how to select an appropriate
technology company to cooperate for the banks has become a key. Miao et al. [54]
developed an MAGDM model with PLTSs for financial technologies selection.
Krishankumar et al. [37] proposed a GDM framework for renewable energy source
selection under interval-valued PLTSs.

Cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a combination of standard ERP
system and cloud flexibility. On the basis of extended probabilistic linguistic
MULTIMOORA method and Choquet integral operator, Chen et al. [7] introduced an
innovative two-step comparative method for the evaluation of cloud-based ERP
systems. Ju et al. [33] presented a framework incorporating the evaluation based on
distance from average solution method for selecting desirable health-care waste
disposal alternative(s), in which multi-granular LDs are adopted by decision makers
to assess the ratings of alternatives and subjective weights of criteria.

(4) Applications in emergency decision making and prioritization events

According to the characteristics of emergency management, Gao et al. [22]
proposed an emergency decision support method by using the PLPR, and a case study
about the emergency decision making in a petrochemical plant fire accident is
conducted to illustrate the proposed method. Li and Wei [42] proposed an emergency
decision-making method based on D-S evidence theory and PLTSs, and applied the
proposed method to an actual mine accident.

With the tremendous growth of cloud vendors, cloud vendor prioritization is a
complex decision-making problem. Sivagami et al. [72] proposed a scientific decision
framework for Cloud Vendor prioritization under PLTSs context with unknown/partial
weight information. Tian et al. [78] presented an improved quality function
deployment for prioritizing service designs, in which multi-granular unbalanced
linguistic term sets are used to capture evaluators’ ratings to cope with vague
information. Moreover, a unification method is proposed to convert multi-granular
linguistic information into LDs.

4, Summary, critical discussion and challenges from the perspective of decision
making and data science/XAI

In this section, we present the summary and critical discussion from a decision

24
making perspective, and also present some ongoing challenges and future research
directions from the perspective of data science and XAI.
4.1. Summary and critical discussion: A decision making perspective

The review about distributed linguistic representations is mainly summarized from
a triple perspective:

(1) Origin of distributed linguistic representations. The distributed linguistic
representations in the literature are mainly derived from: (i) extension of proportional
linguistic 2-tuple representation, including LD, INLD, PLD, and ILD; and (ii)
extending HFLTSs preferences, including PDHFLTS, PHFLTS, PLTS, HLD, and FLE.
Particularly, these distributed linguistic representations can be formed in two ways: (i)
distributed linguistic preference expressions in an individual context; and (ii)
information fusion of linguistic terms or HFLTSs in a group context.

(2) Taxonomy of LD and its variants. We present the taxonomy of distributed
linguistic representations. The LD is the first attempt to model the distributed
linguistic representations among the decision-making community, and the follow-up
notions and concepts are mathematically consistent with LD in some sense: FLE is
the generalization of all the distributed linguistic representations reviewed; LD,
PDHFLTS, PHFLTS, PLTS, PLD, and ILD are special HLDs; PLTS and ILD are
mathematically consistent with PLD; PHFLTS is mathematically consistent with LD;
PDHFLTS is the special case of LD; and INLD is a generalization of LD.

(3) Applications in decision making. We review different applications of distributed
linguistic representations in decision making from four aspects. (i) Distributed
linguistic distance measurements and aggregation methods. Most of them are based
on classical distance measurements and aggregation operators. Moreover,
optimization methods are also developed for dealing with accuracy problems in some
decision contexts. (i) Distributed linguistic pairwise comparison methods, including
three types of distributed linguistic preference relations (i.c., DLPR, PLPR, and
FLPR). (iii) Distributed linguistic MADM approaches. Several researchers revisited
this issue based on classical MADM methods in distributed linguistic contexts. (iv)
Real-life applications, in which participants involved prefer to adopt distributed
linguistic representations to express their preferences to deal with practical decision
problems.

Distributed linguistic representations have been widely studied to model the
uncertainty and complexity of preference information in decision making, but there
still exist some limitations to be further highlighted:

(1) Although distributed linguistic representations have been analyzed from
multiple aspects, it still lacks a systematic research on the transformations among
them. Relevant discussions on transformations from an axiom-based perspective are

of significant necessity, and rational minimum information-loss based transformation
25
models are needed to be designed as well. Notably, normalization methods have been
proposed to transform PLTSs with incompleteness to LDs, but they are questionable.
Thus, reasonable normalization methods from PLTSs to LDs are worth studying.

(2) In distributed linguistic representations many similar concepts have been put
forward, and there is much parallel research in decision-making being undertaken,
which lead to lots of repeated discussions and confusion of concepts. Therefore, it is
necessary to focus on the original one and undertake valuable research and
comparisons. Particularly, the FLE will be a potential tool in distributed linguistic
representations to form a unified framework.

4.2. Challenges in data science and artificial intelligence: An explainable
linguistic approach

The development of data science and artificial intelligence, particularly the efforts
currently being made in the area of XAI [4], has provided enormous opportunities as
well as arising challenges. How to fix the idea of XAI, and the opportunity to use
linguistic information for representing the cognitive complex expressions from
decision makers/experts or data driven approaches getting linguistic labels as
knowledge, is needed to be addressed.

(1) Natural language processing (NLP) method. NLP is a significant artificial
intelligence-based tool to process information linguistically. The potential in using
NLP approaches in decision making has been partially shown in the literature [124],
and the research on opinion mining from user data is being undertaken, such as
accurate recognition of specific behaviors [5], credit risk assessments [61], etc. The
advent of data science has brought the chance that NLP-based techniques can be used
to handle a wider range of linguistic data [27], [36]. Particular attention should be
paid to the data driven decision making using distributed linguistic representations as
a representation approach for getting the information, experts’ assessments from the
data, and using NLP approaches for getting linguistic assessments from linguistic
opinions. Essentially, challenges under this perspective rely on how to apply these
NLP-based techniques (¢.g., sentiment analysis) as well as data-driven technologies to
analyze decision makers’ distributed linguistic data, and emphasize on the necessity to
figure out the characteristics of complexity of distributed linguistic information, and
the difficulty to effectively handle these complexity with data-driven NLP tools.

(2) Data fusion with data-driven and/or artificial intelligent approaches. In the
extent reviewed literature about the fusion methods of distributed linguistic
information in decision making problems, the popular methods are based on the
aggregation operators and mathematical optimization modelling. The development of
mass media and internet technologies has witnessed more and more direct or indirect
participation from different groups in the process of decision making. Complex

26
distributed linguistic preferences are provided by decision makers with varying social
backgrounds, self-confidence levels, knowledge structures, etc., and some key
elements begin to appear in the decision making at a large scale [15], such as
interactions with behaviors among decision makers/experts [6], [65], [93].

The challenges in this perspective centralize on coping with enormous amounts of
distributed linguistic information from disparate data sources with data-driven and/or
intelligent approaches. The analysis or processing of such information is no longer
using traditional decision support tools or simple aggregation techniques. In contrast
to the black models provided by the neural network based approaches, whose utility in
data analysis have been limited because of the interpretation difficulty, linguistic
based models with explainability are much more suitable. How to fuse these data and
how to acquire significant insights from these data are still the future research needed
to be investigated.

(3) Data-driven preference learning methods. Preference learning is a new
research field of the intersection of machine learning and decision making. The
preference learning mainly focuses on the analysis of individual and group
characteristics, and modelling group/multi-attribute preference learning functions by
learning historical data [2], [13]. It is worth pointing out that the advent of data
science and artificial intelligence highlights the importance of preference learning
methodology driven by large scale data sets [68]. The potential of applying
data-driven preference learning methods in linguistic decision making is still under
development. For example, how to learn the word encoding (semantic analysis),
which is the core of CW, and model PIS-based semantic learning from distributed
linguistic data at a large scale, is a problem worthy of further study.

Recent studies [1], [108] suggested that deep learning approaches are playing vital
roles in parameter estimating and parameter settings for correlated features of
decision models. Thereby, this learning method could be used to estimate optimal
weights of multiple attributes in distributed linguistic MADM, and to determine
suitable parameter settings for aggregation functions in the fusion process of
distributed linguistic data. The potential of these machine learning methods can be
detected in various practical applications, such as financial risk analysis [35], online
social recommendation [122], etc.

(4) Social network analysis (SNA) applications. With the development of social
media and communication technologies, it is easier to obtain the access to information
about social networks, which makes interactions among decision makers become
increasingly common. As a powerful tool, SNA has been investigated to support the
decision process from many aspects such as opinion dynamics [20], trust/distrust
relationships [79], [117], GDM [19], and LSDM [15], in which relationships among

decision makers are modelled in a social network. Combining the distributed
27
trust/distrust relationships among decision makers analyzed by SNA, the preference
characteristics of decision makers are identified, which can further support the
management of decision makers’ behaviors and the approaches for generating
recommendations to improve the efficiency of decision process. It would also be
interesting to apply these SNA-based decision models into real-life decision problems.
For example, in the hotel selection driven by online textual reviews [62], customers’
sentiments can be analyzed to extract both preferences and distributed trust
relationship information as an input for decision models.

(5) Online customer reviews application. Mass media and platforms have been
vested with significant power in society. For example, it is noted that the spread of
e-commerce platforms and mobile apps have improved customers’ ability to assess
products online. Online reviews on various e-commerce platforms have become an
important part of the electronic word of mouth and the important references for
potential customers to make decisions [48]. These online reviews/data have
significant distribution characteristics and effective analysis or processing of these
data can help enterprises/government understand the consumer preference much better,
and make rational decision accordingly.

In future research, a comprehensive analysis of the complexity of consumption data
sources is needed. In particular, NLP-based, emotion recognition-based [121],
SNA-based, and PIS-based approaches [45] are powerful tools to better and
accurately understand the sociality and individuality of customers through these
distributed linguistic data.

5. Conclusion

We review the distributed linguistic representations in decision making from a
triple perspective of taxonomy, key elements and applications, and ongoing
challenges. Specifically, we analyze the origin of existing distributed linguistic
representations in the literature, which are classified into two types: extension of
proportional linguistic 2-tuple representation, and HFLTS based _ extended
representation. Particularly, these distributed linguistic representations can be formed
in two ways: linguistic preference expressions in an individual context, and
information fusion of linguistic terms or HFLTSs in a group context. Furthermore, we
summarize the key elements and applications of distributed linguistic representations
in various decision problems, including distributed linguistic distance measurements
and aggregation methods; distributed linguistic preference relations; distributed
linguistic MADM; and some real-life applications. Finally, we critically discuss the
concept confusion issues of distributed linguistic representations, and propose the
challenges and future directions from the perspective of data science and XAI.
